       ----------------- 
       Step 1 : Sign in to the azure portal
       step 2 : Select Resource (Create resource)
       step 3 : Search for "Virtual network" (Create VNet)
       step 4 : Fill in the required fields such as the name, address space and subscription.
       step 5 : Select the "CREATE" button to create the VNet.
Repeat the above steps for the rest of the VNets you Want to create.

TASK 2:
    Management VNet (HUB):
    A management VNet, also known as hub VNet, the hub VNet acts as a central point of connectivity for the spoke VNets allowing resource in the spoke
    VNets,to communicate with each other and with resources in one or more connected VNets, also Known as spoke VNets
    step 1: Sign in to the azure portal
    step 2: select resource (create resource)
    step 3: search for "virtualNetwork" and select it from the results.
    step 4: Fill in the required fields, such as the name,address space and subscription.
    step 5: In the "Advanced" section,select "Add a virtualNetwork" to create a hub-spoke topology.
    step 6: select the "create" button to create the VNet.

TASK 3:
Create the Production VNet

Sign in to Azure, go to "Virtual Networks," and click "Create."
Enter details like the VNet's name, region, and address range.
Add Subnets for Different Resources

Inside the production VNet, create separate subnets for resources like web servers, databases, and load balancers.
Assign each subnet its own IP range to keep resources organized and scalable.
Set Up Security Protections

Attach Network Security Groups (NSGs) to each subnet to manage which traffic can enter or leave.
Add firewall rules within NSGs to allow or block specific traffic.
You might also add an Azure Firewall to protect the entire network.
Enable Secure Connections

If needed, set up a VPN gateway for secure access to on-premises networks.
For faster, private connections, consider using Azure ExpressRoute.
Keep Production Separate from Other Networks

Make sure the production VNet is isolated from development and test networks.
Use VNet peering carefully if you need to connect to other VNets, and add security rules to limit access.
Review and Test Settings

Double-check all configurations to ensure they follow security guidelines.
Test connectivity and security to make sure production resources are secure.

TASK 4:
4. Testing Vnet:
----------------
A Testing VNet in Azure is a virtual network that is used for testing and development purposes.

It is a separate network environment that is isolated from the production network and allows for testing of new configurations, updates, and deployments 
without affecting the production environment.
The Testing VNet can be used to test new software, applications, and updates before they are deployed to the production network.
This helps ensure that any issues or bugs are identified and resolved before they can cause problems in the production environment.
Additionally, the Testing VNet can be used to test disaster recovery plans and network configurations, ensuring that they are effective and 
reliable before they are implemented in the production network.

TASK 5:
step 1:Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/)

step 2:Click on the "Create a resource" button in the top left corner of the portal

step 3:In the search bar, type "Virtual Network" and select the "Virtual Network" option from the list

step 4:Click the "Create" button

step 5:In the "Basics" tab, enter a name for the virtual network, select the subscription and resource group you want to use. Make sure you name it developing Vnet for easy identification.

step 6:In the "Address space" tab, enter the IP address range for the virtual network. This is the range of IP addresses that will be available for use within the virtual network.

step 7:In the "Subnets" tab, create a new subnet for the developing VNet. This subnet will be used for all developing resources, such as virtual machines, load balancers, and network interfaces.

step 8:In the "Security" tab, you can configure the security settings for the virtual network. This includes firewall rules, network security groups, and VPN connections.

step 9:In the "Tags" tab, you can add any tags that you want to use to organize your virtual network.

step 10:Click the "Review + Create" button to review the configuration, and then click "Create" to create the virtual network.

step 11:"Wait for the virtual network to be created. This process may take a few minutes.

step 12:Once the virtual network is created, you can navigate to the virtual network in the Azure portal to view and manage it.

step 13:Now you have to create Hub and spoke architecture. To do that, you need to create Hub VNet and then connect it to multiple spoke VNets.

step 14:To create a Hub VNet, go to the Azure portal, and click on the "Create a resource" button. Select "Virtual Network" and click "Create".

step 15:In the "Basics" tab, enter a name for the hub VNet, select the subscription and resource group.

step 16:In the "Address space" tab, enter the IP address range for the hub VNet.

step 17:In the "Subnets" tab, create a new subnet for the hub VNet. This subnet will be used for all hub resources, such as virtual machines, load balancers, and network interfaces.

step 18:In the "Security" tab, you can configure the security settings for the hub VNet. This includes firewall rules, network security groups, and VPN connections.

step 19:In the "Tags" tab, you can add any tags that you want to use to organize your hub VNet.

step 20:Click the "Review + Create" button to review the configuration, and then click "Create" to create the hub VNet.

step 21:Now you have to connect the spoke VNets to the hub VNet. Go to the Azure portal and select the spoke VNet that you want to connect.

step 22:In the spoke VNet, go to the "Connectivity" tab, and click on the "Add" button to add a new connection.

step 23:Select "Virtual Network" as the connection type and enter the details of the hub VNet.

step 24:Click "Save" to create the connection.

step 25:Repeat steps 21-24 for all spoke VNets that you want to connect to the hub VNet.

step 26:Once you have created the hub and spoke architecture, you can now launch virtual machines in each VNet
