Under Keys and Endpoint, copy the Key 1 or Key 2 and the Endpoint URL. These are required for API integration.
Step 4: Configure Storage for Audio Files
Search for Storage Account in the Azure Portal.
Click + Create and set up a storage account:
Choose the same resource group as your Speech Service.
Set other configurations like storage performance, replication, etc.
Upload your audio files to a container in the storage account.
Step 5: Use the Speech-to-Text API
Write a script or use Azure tools to connect to the Speech Service API.
Use Azure SDKs (like azure-cognitiveservices-speech for Python) or REST APIs.
Provide the endpoint URL, API key, and audio file details.
Integrate the API call into your application or workflow to process audio files for transcription.
Step 6: Automate Workflow with Logic Apps
Search for Logic Apps in the Azure Portal.
Click + Create to set up a new Logic App:
Select the resource group and region.
Use the Logic App Designer to create workflows.
Add triggers and actions:
Trigger: For example, monitor when a new file is uploaded to your storage account.
Action: Call the Speech-to-Text API to transcribe the audio file.
Action: Save the transcription to a file or database.
Step 7: Test and Monitor
Upload an audio file to your storage account to trigger the workflow.
Monitor the Logic App runs under the Runs History tab.
Verify the transcription output in the specified storage or database.
Step 8: Deploy and Scale
Enable auto-scaling or adjust the Speech Serviceâ€™s pricing tier for production workloads.
Use Azure Monitor to track usage and performance metrics.
Ensure proper error handling and logging in your workflow
