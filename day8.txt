Step 1: Understand the Availability Set Concept
->Fault Domains (FDs): Protect VMs from hardware failures.
->Update Domains (UDs): Protect VMs from simultaneous updates or maintenance.
->Specify the number of FDs and UDs during Availability Set creation.
Step 2: Create an Availability Set
->Navigate to the Azure Portal.
->Search for Availability Set in the search bar and click on it.
->Click Create to start the creation process.
->Fill in the required details:
->Resource Group Name: Select or create a new one.
->Availability Set Name: Enter a unique name.
->Region: Select the Azure region.
->Fault Domains: Choose the number of FDs (2 or 3).
->Update Domains: Choose the number of UDs (e.g., 5).
->Click Review + Create and then Create to deploy the Availability Set.
Step 3: Launch a Virtual Machine into the Availability Set
->Go to Virtual Machines in the Azure Portal.
->Click Create to start creating a new VM.
->Under the Basics tab, enter:
->Resource Group Name: Use the same as the Availability Set.
->VM Name, Region, and Size.
->In the Availability Options field, select Availability Set.
->From the dropdown, choose the Availability Set you created in Step 2.
Step 4: Configure the Virtual Machine
->Configure Disks, Networking, and Management based on your requirements.
->Click Review + Create, then Create to launch the VM.
Step 5: Add Additional VMs to the Availability Set
->Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 for any additional VMs to be part of the same Availability Set.
Step 6: Verify the Availability Set Setup
->Navigate to the Availability Set resource in the Azure Portal.
->Check the Distribution of VMs across Fault Domains and Update Domains.
