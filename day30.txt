üöÄ Project Overview
This repository documents my journey through the 30-Day Azure Challenge, where I explored and mastered various Azure services. For my final project, I developed a solution using Azure OpenAI Services, integrated with Activity Logs for real-time monitoring and insights.

Key Features
Configured Azure OpenAI Services to leverage advanced AI models for innovative solutions.
Integrated Activity Logs to monitor real-time service usage and performance.
Enabled diagnostic settings for comprehensive insights into system activities.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Azure OpenAI Services: For deploying and managing AI models.
Activity Logs: For monitoring and analyzing service performance in real-time.
Log Analytics Workspace: To query and visualize logs.
Azure Monitor: For creating custom dashboards and reports.
üìù Steps to Recreate the Project
1. Create an Azure OpenAI Resource
Log in to Azure Portal.
Search for Azure OpenAI and create a resource.
Configure the resource by selecting the appropriate subscription, resource group, and region.
Deploy the desired AI model (e.g., GPT-3) from the Model Deployments section.
2. Enable Activity Logs
Go to the Monitoring section of the Azure OpenAI resource.
Access Activity Log to view and analyze service operations.
Set up Alerts to notify you of specific events or errors.
3. Configure Diagnostic Settings
Enable diagnostic settings in the Monitoring section.
Send logs to a Log Analytics workspace, Storage Account, or Event Hub.
Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) in Log Analytics to query logs.
4. Monitor in Real-Time
Access Azure Monitor Workbooks to visualize usage metrics and performance.
Create custom dashboards to track AI model usage patterns and latency.
üåü Highlights of the Journey
Explored various Azure services, including Azure SQL, Azure Web Apps, and Azure OpenAI.
Successfully integrated real-time monitoring into an AI-powered service.
Gained hands-on experience with Azure Activity Logs, Diagnostic Settings, and Log Analytics.
