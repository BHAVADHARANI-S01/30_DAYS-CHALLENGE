
Step 1: Log in to Azure Portal
•Open Azure Portal in your browser.
•Sign in with your Azure account.

Step 2: Select Your Virtual Machine
•In the left menu, click on Virtual Machines.
•Select the virtual machine where your Docker container is running.

Step 3: Attach a Disk to the VM (Optional)
•Go to the Disks section of the VM.
•Click Add Data Disk and attach a new disk.
•Follow Azure’s prompts to format and mount the disk (if needed).

Step 4: Connect to Your Virtual Machine
•Use SSH to connect to the VM:
•ssh <username>@<VM-IP-address>
•Navigate to the directory you want to mount (e.g., /data).
Step 5: Run the Docker Command with Volume Mount

•Use the following command to run your Docker container with the volume:
•docker run -v /host/path:/container/path <image-name>
•Replace /host/path with the directory on your VM (e.g., /data).
•Replace /container/path with the directory inside the container (e.g., /app/data).
•Example:
•docker run -v /data:/app/data nginx:latest

Step 6: Verify the Volume is Mounted
•Once the container is running, access it using:
•docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash
•Navigate to the mounted directory (/app/data in the example) to confirm the files are accessible.
