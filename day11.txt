Step 1: Navigate to the Azure Portal
->Open your browser and go to Azure Portal.
->Sign in to your Azure account.

Step 2: Create an Application Gateway
->In the Azure portal, click on "Create a resource" in the left-hand menu.
->Search for "Application Gateway" in the search bar and select it.
->Click on the "Create" button.

Step 3: Configure the Basics
->Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.
->Resource Group: Select an existing resource group or create a new one.
->Region: Choose the Azure region where you want to deploy the gateway.
->Name: Provide a name for your application gateway.
->Tier: Choose the desired SKU and size (e.g., Standard_v2, WAF_v2). The size depends on your workload.
->Click Next to proceed.

Step 4: Set Up Frontend IP
->Under Frontend IP configuration, choose Public.
->Assign a new public IP address by selecting Add new and providing a name for the public IP.
->Click Next: Backend pool to proceed.

Step 5: Configure the Backend Pool
->Under Backend pools, click Add a backend pool.
->Provide a name for the backend pool (e.g., "AppServicePool").
->Under Add backend targets, select App Services.
->Choose the App Service that you want to connect to the application gateway.
->Click Add and then Next: Configuration.

Step 6: Set Up Listeners
->Under Listeners, click Add a listener.
->Listener name: Provide a name for the listener (e.g., "AppListener").
->Frontend IP: Select the public IP created in Step 4.
->Protocol: Choose HTTP or HTTPS depending on your app’s requirements.
->If using HTTPS, upload an SSL certificate.
->Port: Enter the port number (default is 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS).
->Click Add and then Next: Rules.

Step 7: Configure Routing Rules
->Under Routing rules, click Add a routing rule.
->Rule name: Provide a name (e.g., "AppRule").
->Listener: Select the listener created in Step 6.
->Backend targets: Choose the backend pool created in Step 5.
->Backend settings: Configure settings like HTTP timeout or create a new one if needed.
->Click Add and then Next: Tags.

Step 8: Review and Create
->Optionally, add tags for easier resource management.
->Click Next: Review + create.
->Review all the configurations and click Create to deploy the application gateway. The deployment may take several minutes.

Step 9: Retrieve the Application Gateway Public IP or FQDN
->After deployment, go to the Overview page of the application gateway.
->Copy the Public IP address or FQDN of the application gateway.

Step 10: Update DNS Settings
->If you have a custom domain, go to your DNS provider’s management portal.
->Create a CNAME record pointing your custom domain to the FQDN of the application gateway.
->Example: www.yourdomain.com -> <app-gateway-fqdn>.
->Alternatively, you can update the A record with the public IP address of the application gateway.

Step 11: Access Your App Service Through the Gateway
->Open your browser and enter the public IP address, FQDN, or your custom domain (if DNS is configured).
->You should now be able to access your Azure App Service through the application gateway.
